# Future Development
[ ] Change navbar for guests to only view Login --- once on login page there is a link for "do you need to register first?"

[ ] Display username on navbar (or elsewhere) to show we have a true logged in state

[ ] Make draggable items save their new order

[ ] Sweet Alert: Register: email already in database -- right now multiple users can register with the same email (same email, different username & password)

[ ] Sweet Alert: Login: alert when login and password do not match 

[ ] Update README.md (description and usage doesn't match up with what we created)

[ ] Account page displays current projects

[ ] Account page - user can delete project

[ ] Account page - user can edit project
